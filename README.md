## Why?
I'm not the biggest sports fan but care a lot about specific matches of football, hockey and tennis. Because I'm not out there daily checking who plays who, important matches slip through my fingers. So I decided to develop a way for me to never miss the matches I want to see.

## What?
A simple python program that will notify me through my email about matches I that are happening on a certain day.

## How?
It is important to me that the program is as independant as it could. This means I want to avoid some APIs that would probably make my life a little easier but make me dependant on a service that, in the future, might be behind a pay wall. Instead, I feel that a much safer and future proof solution is parsing whole HTML files from sites that have been for years providing this information for free.
